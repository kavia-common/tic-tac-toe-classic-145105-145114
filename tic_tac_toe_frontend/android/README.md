# Android Native Project Placeholder

This directory is intentionally absent in the repository for an Expo-managed workflow. It is generated by running:

- expo prebuild --platform android
  or
- npm run build:android:ci (which runs prebuild and then Gradle)

If your CI or local environment is calling `./gradlew` directly and this file is the only content here, it means the prebuild step did not run. Update your pipeline to run the prebuild step first or use EAS builds.

Do not commit generated native code unless migrating away from Expo-managed workflow.
